# Harmonic Path Finder

In terms of music theory, moving from one chord to another can be described in different ways.
For instance, getting to the chord D minor from C major is simple (D minor is simply the "ii" of C).
But getting to E major from C major, for instance, is different. E major could be described as the "III" of C, but the 3rd degree of a major scale is normally minor.
If you instead go to the "V" of C (G major), and then to the "V" of that, you have arrived at D major in a way that follows modern Western music theory.

This is a script I wrote to find many different paths one could take to get from the "I" to any other chord (major, minor, or diminished).
